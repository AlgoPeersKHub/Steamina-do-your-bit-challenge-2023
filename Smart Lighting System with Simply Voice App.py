## Introduction
   Hey User! Meet our Smart Lighting System. It's a cool setup that listens to your voice through the Simply Voice app, made with MIT App Inventor. 
   Want the lights on? Just say it. 
   Time for lights out? Say the word, and it's done. 
   It's not just smart; it's super easy. Welcome to a lighting experience that's as simple as talking! ðŸŒŸðŸ’¬ðŸ’¡


## Parts of the Micro:bit Used
  
   Pins : (Digital Pin Control) Utilizing the pins.digital_write_pin() function to control the state of digital pin P1 (turning it off with 0).

   LEDs: Showing various icons on the micro:bit display using basic.show_icon().

## Programming Concepts
  
   Variable: The creation and initialization of the variable cmd to an empty string ("").

   Function: Defining functions (on_bluetooth_connected(), on_bluetooth_disconnected(), on_uart_data_received()) to encapsulate specific sets of actions.
   
   Global Variable : The use of the global keyword to indicate that the variable cmd is a global variable accessible throughout the program.
 
   Bluetooth Connection Handling: Setting up functions (on_bluetooth_connected(), on_bluetooth_disconnected()) to execute specific actions when Bluetooth is connected or disconnected.

   UART Communication Setup: Initiating the UART service for Bluetooth communication using bluetooth.start_uart_service().

   UART Data Reception and Processing: Reading UART data until a hash delimiter is encountered (bluetooth.uart_read_until(serial.delimiters(Delimiters.HASH))) and processing the received command accordingly.

   Conditional Statements: Using if, elif, and else statements to conditionally execute code based on the value of the received command.

   String Comparison: Comparing strings (e.g., cmd.lower() == "on") to determine specific actions based on the received command.

   UART Data Transmission: Sending data back to the connected device using bluetooth.uart_write_string(cmd).


## Programming Language
   Python

## Coding Environment / Text Editor
